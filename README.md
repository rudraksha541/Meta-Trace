# 🧠🔐 MetaTrace — AI-Powered Metadata Security on Blockchain

MetaTrace is a powerful web application that uses **AI/ML** and **Polkadot blockchain** to **extract, analyze, and secure metadata** from digital files. It also enables **NFT minting** of critical files to ensure tamper-proof ownership and traceability.

---

## 🌍 Vision

In a world flooded with digital content, **trust and authenticity** have become critical. MetaTrace envisions a future where **metadata — the digital fingerprint of every file — becomes a secure, transparent, and verifiable source of truth.**

We aim to **empower users, regardless of their technical background**, to **verify file integrity, detect tampering**, and **preserve digital trust** using the combined power of **AI** and **Polkadot blockchain technology**. MetaTrace is not just a tool — it's a safeguard for **journalists, forensic analysts, legal professionals, and everyday users** who rely on accurate, unaltered digital evidence.

## 🛠 Problem This Project Solves

### 📌 The Problem

With the rise in **digital manipulation, misinformation, and deepfakes**, detecting whether a document, image, or media file has been tampered with is harder than ever. Critical metadata — such as timestamps, GPS coordinates, or camera details — can easily be edited or erased, making it difficult to:

- ✅ Authenticate media sources  
- ✅ Verify legal and forensic documents  
- ✅ Maintain transparency in journalism and public investigations  
- ✅ Detect unauthorized changes in sensitive data  

Moreover, most existing tools:
- Require **technical expertise**,  
- Do **not secure metadata from tampering**, and  
- Lack **traceability or auditability**.

---

### 🧠 Our Solution — MetaTrace

MetaTrace solves this by:

- 🧩 **Extracting and analyzing metadata** using AI & ML (Isolation Forest anomaly detection + Groq AI)  
- 🧠 **Detecting signs of tampering** or anomalies automatically  
- 🔐 **Storing metadata on IPFS**, and saving its hash securely on **Polkadot Assethub** using smart contracts  
- 🎨 **Minting NFTs** for important files on **Polkadot AssetHub**
- 💻 Providing a **user-friendly interface** for tech and non-tech users alike
- **All file formats are accepted(jpg,png,mpv4,doc,pdf,zip, etc..)**
